# Github metrics poc 

A quick poc to understand some github and zenhub metrics capabilities 

In particular the following user stories

```
Given a github repo
For a given period of time ~ less say a month
I want to get a metric of the #nummer of issues of a type by different categories
Where 
- categories are labels
- issues are labels
```
